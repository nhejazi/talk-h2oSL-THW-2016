## Nima Hejazi & Evan Muzzall

Nima is a graduate student in the Division of Biostatistics. His research
combines aspects of causal inference, statistical machine learning, and
nonparametric statistics, with a focus on the development of robust methods for
addressing inference problems arising in precision medicine, computational
biology, and clinical trials.

Evan earned his Ph.D. in Biological Anthropology from Southern Illinois
University Carbondale where he focused on spatial patterns of skeletal and
dental variation in two large necropoles of Iron Age Central Italy (1st
millennium BC). He is currently R Lead Instructor, co-founder of the Machine Learning Working Group, and Research Associate in the D-Lab.
