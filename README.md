## Description

These are materials for a working group presentation given on methods for
performing ensemble machine learning with [Super
Learner](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperLearner/index.html) and
[H2O](http://www.h2o.ai) using the [R language for statistical
computing](https://www.r-project.org), given at a meeting of [The Hacker
Within](http://www.thehackerwithin.org/berkeley/posts/ensemble-R), at the
[Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) on Tuesday, 6
December 2016.
